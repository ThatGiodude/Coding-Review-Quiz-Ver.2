# Coding-Review-Quiz-Ver.2

## Initial Problems

I remember having a ton of problems with this months ago. I tried to link multiple different pages togehter and realized that it wasn't the correct way to go about it. 
I decided to start over from scratch and decided to merge my questions.js page with the main script to make it easier and overall made the work a lot more streamlined.
I definitely wanted to do something a bit more flashy but overall there's functionality with the quiz, I think it's easy to read, and overall very streamlined.
I also wanted to add ways to clear the local storage and to also reset the quiz so I went a little out of the way for that.

## Challenges 

The biggest challenge I had was to merge the code from my older repo into this one. When I started the class I would mess up my repos constantly and ran into that issue.
Deciding to go back to scratch helped a ton and going backwards to work on this after doing more complicated work definitely helped a lot.
I am also still terrible when it comes to CSS so I had to find a simple template online to work with. The color scheme is more my style but overall it helped a ton. Bootstrap next time for sure.

## Future Updates

I would like to add pictures and make the quiz a bit more interactive, and even add more review questions and maybe some inputs to really test people.
Also might add a function to stop the timer from going when you aren't taking the quiz. It's not incredible relevant at the moment though.
